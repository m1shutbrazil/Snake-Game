# Snake Game

This is a simple terminal-based Snake game implemented in C++.

## Features

- Classic Snake game mechanics
- Playable in the terminal
- Control the snake using arrow keys
- Food randomly appears on the screen
- The snake grows in length when it eats food
- The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself

## How to Play

- Control the snake using arrow keys:
  - Up arrow: Move up
  - Down arrow: Move down
  - Left arrow: Move left
  - Right arrow: Move right
- Your goal is to eat the food (represented by `*`) and avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
- Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.
- The game ends if the snake crashes into the walls or its own body.
